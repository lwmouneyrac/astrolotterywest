The coming together of Lotterywest and [Healthway](https://www.healthway.wa.gov.au/) created an opportunity to better align our grant making strategy, and build synergies to maximise our community support.

Lotterywest and Healthway are committed to building a better and healthier Western Australia through supporting grants for the community.

Healthway is passionate about local community initiatives, programs, research, and partnerships that empower the community to adopt healthier lifestyles.

Healthway does this by working in partnership with sports, arts, racing, and community event organisations, as well as health and research organisations to build a healthier WA.

Please visit the [Healthway website](https://www.healthway.wa.gov.au/) for more information.
