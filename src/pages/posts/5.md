Western Australia is home to four Saturday Lotto Division One prizes, each worth $909,000. The tickets were sold from Phoenix Newsagency, London Court News and Lotteries, Shenton News and Post and Phoenix Lotteries.

Lotterywest spokesperson James Mooney said Saturday’s result marks WA’s first Division One wins for 2023.

“We finished last year with 75 Division One winners, so fingers crossed we can better that tally in 2023,” he said. “This win follows WA’s $3.3 million win from New Year’s Eve, which was another fantastic Saturday Lotto win for WA players.”

“We are still on the lookout for the owner of the $3.3 million New Year’s Eve Megadraw ticket, so if you had a game in tonight or last Saturday’s draw, please check your numbers.”

The good news for WA continued with 11 Division Two tickets also sold in Saturday's draw, with each worth around $10,800.

Thanks to WA players and retailers, 2022 saw more than $303 million go back to WA Community group via Lotterywest grants program.
